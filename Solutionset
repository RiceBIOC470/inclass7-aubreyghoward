%Inclass assignment 7. 
% 1. The gene Cdx2 is a crucial transcription factor involved in number of
% developmental stages. Use the UCSC genome browser to answer the following questions
% about it:

% A. What human chromosome is it located on?
        %Chromosome 13
% B. How many exons does it have?
        % 3 exons
% C. What is the precise position of its stop codon in the genome?
        % 27,963,117

% D. Identify at least one difference in sequence between human and mouse
% CDX2.
        %there is P309S change between Humans and Mouse CDX2

% E. In which human tissues is it expressed most abundantly?
        %CDX2 is significantly expressed in the colon, small intestine, and pancrease.

%2. A. Use the unigene database to find the accession number for a genbank
% entry containing the complete coding sequence of Cdx2. 
        % Hs.174249
% B. Use MATLAB to read the genbank information corresponding to that
% accession number. 
genbank_dat = getgenbank('NM_001265.4');
% C. Use the information read in to find the position of the start and stop
% codon within the sequence. What are the parts of the sequence before the start codon 
% and after the stop codon?

seq = 'atg';
start = strfind(genbank_dat.Sequence,seq);
q = 1;
for ii = 1:length(start)
if rem(start(ii),3) == 0
    startcodon(q,1) = start(ii);
    q = q+1;
end
end

seq = 'tga';
stop = strfind(genbank_dat.Sequence,seq);
q = 1;
for ii = 1:length(stop)
if rem(stop(ii),3) == 0
    stopcodon(q,1) = stop(ii);
    q = q+1;
end
end

%the regions of DNA beyond this part of the DNA is considered the UTR. 

% D. Use the protein_id to read the information on the protein. Use the
% information you read to determine where the homeobox domain of the protein is.
% Hint: see the field "Features". 
protein_dat = getgenpept(genbank_dat.CDS.protein_id)
protein_dat.Features

%the homeobox is upstream of the start codon from position 190-242 in the
%sequence above.
